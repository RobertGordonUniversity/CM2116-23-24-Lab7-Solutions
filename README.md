# CM2116 Lab 7

## Aims

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

* Understand implementations of Queues using an array
* Understand implementations of Stacks using an array
* Implement an application of a Stack

## Using the repo

You should complete the exercises like any other GitHub Classroom "assignment" you've done before. As with last week's lab, when you push your code, it is automatically tested and the results indicated by either a tick or a cross in the bar above the list of files. Clicking this icon, then clicking **Details** will take you to a page showing the test results.
